## 🎮 What is Guessmetry?

Guessmetry is a unique word guessing game that flips traditional Pictionary on its head. Instead of seeing drawings, you read descriptions of geometric shapes arranged in specific ways (like "a triangle sitting on top of a square") and race against the clock to guess what object is being described. It's a mental visualization challenge that tests your spatial reasoning and creative thinking.

The game runs directly inside Reddit posts as a native Devvit app, providing a seamless experience without leaving the platform. Built with React 19 and powered by Devvit's serverless infrastructure, it combines fast-paced gameplay with Reddit's community features.

### Two Ways to Play

**🎯 Classic Mode**: Traditional gameplay where you match pre-defined correct answers. Earn 10 points for exact matches and 5 points for close answers using intelligent string similarity detection. Perfect for solo play and quick 3-5 minute sessions.

**👥 Consensus Mode**: Revolutionary crowd-sourced gameplay inspired by r/place's voting visualization. Earn points by matching what other players guess, not a "correct" answer. Watch live poll results update in real-time as the community determines what's "correct" - even if it differs from the creator's intent! Earn up to 100 points for majority answers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### How to Play in 30 Seconds

1. **Launch**: Click "Launch App" on any Guessmetry post on Reddit
2. **Choose Mode**: Select Classic Mode (🎯) or Consensus Mode (👥) from the home screen
3. **Read**: Memorize the geometric description during the 5-second display phase
4. **Guess**: Type your answer within 20 seconds
5. **Score**: See your results and watch your score update
6. **Repeat**: Play through 25 unique prompts per session

### Game Flow

Each round follows a three-phase cycle:

- **Display Phase (5s)**: Read and memorize the geometric description
- **Guess Phase (20s)**: Type your answer before time runs out  
- **Results Phase (10-15s)**: See if you were right and watch your score update

### Scoring

**Classic Mode:**
- ✅ Correct answer: **+10 points** (exact match or alternative answer)
- 🟡 Close answer: **+5 points** (70%+ similarity using Levenshtein distance)
- ❌ Incorrect: **0 points**

**Consensus Mode:**
- 🏆 Majority (≥50%): **+100 points**
- 🥈 Common (20-49%): **+50 points**
- 🥉 Uncommon (5-19%): **+25 points**
- 💎 Rare (1-4%): **+10 points**
- ❄️ Unique (<1%): **0 points**

## 💡 What Makes Guessmetry Innovative?

Guessmetry stands out from traditional guessing games with several groundbreaking innovations that make it uniquely suited for Reddit's community-driven platform:

### 1. **Reverse Pictionary Concept**
Instead of drawing pictures, the game describes geometric arrangements, flipping the traditional Pictionary format. You must imagine the shapes and deduce what object they form - turning abstract descriptions into concrete objects in your mind. For example, "a triangle sitting on top of a square" becomes "house" in your imagination. This creates a unique mental visualization challenge that's different from any other game on Reddit.

### 2. **Dual Gameplay Modes**
Guessmetry offers two distinct ways to play, each with its own strategic depth:

- **Classic Mode**: Test your spatial reasoning against pre-defined answers with intelligent fuzzy matching. Perfect for solo play and quick sessions.
- **Consensus Mode**: Think like the crowd and earn points by matching popular opinion rather than a single "correct" answer. The community determines what's right - even if it differs from the creator's intent!

Seamlessly switch between modes from the home screen to experience both gameplay styles.

### 3. **Intelligent Answer Matching**
The game uses advanced string similarity algorithms (Levenshtein distance) to recognize close answers (like "hous" for "house" or "bycicle" for "bicycle"), making it forgiving while still challenging. You get partial credit (5 points) for being close with a 70%+ similarity threshold! The algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform one string into another, then converts this to a percentage similarity score.

### 4. **Reddit-Native Experience**
Built specifically for Reddit using Devvit Web, the game runs directly in Reddit posts with full integration of Reddit's authentication and community features. No external websites, apps, or logins required - just click "Launch App" in the post and start playing right in your feed. Your Reddit username is automatically recognized and displayed throughout the game.

### 5. **Live Crowd-Consensus Innovation** (Consensus Mode)
Inspired by r/place's voting visualization, Consensus Mode transforms the game from matching a single "correct" answer to earning points by thinking like the crowd. If 85% of players say "jellyfish" but the creator intended "house," jellyfish becomes the culturally correct answer. Features include:

- **Live poll visualization** with animated percentage bars showing each guess's popularity
- **Real-time updates** every 2 seconds as more players join the session
- **Tiered scoring system** rewarding popular thinking (Majority: 100pts, Common: 50pts, Uncommon: 25pts, Rare: 10pts, Unique: 0pts)
- **Viral moment detection** when crowd consensus differs significantly from creator's intent
- **Creator's answer marked** with gold star (⭐) even if unpopular, showing what was intended vs. what the crowd chose

### 6. **Three-Phase Gameplay Loop**
Each round follows a carefully timed sequence that creates a perfect rhythm:
- **Display Phase** (5s): Read and memorize the geometric description
- **Guess Phase** (20s): Type your answer before time runs out
- **Results Phase** (10-15s): See if you were right and watch your score update

This creates a fast-paced rhythm that keeps you engaged without feeling rushed, perfect for quick Reddit browsing sessions.

### 7. **Session-Based Prompt Management**
The game tracks which prompts you've seen using Redis sorted sets, ensuring you never encounter the same prompt twice in a session. Once you've played all 25 prompts, the session completes gracefully. Each session is isolated with a unique ID, and session data expires after 1 hour to prevent memory bloat.

### 8. **Mobile-First Design**
Clean, responsive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile Reddit users with Reddit's signature orange (#FF4500) color scheme, smooth CSS animations, and comprehensive accessibility features built in from the ground up (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, reduced motion support, high contrast colors).

### Classic Mode Gameplay

**Round Flow (repeats for each prompt):**

The game cycles through three phases for each round:

**Phase 1 - Display Phase (5 seconds):**

- A geometric description appears on screen in large, readable text (e.g., "A circle on top of a rectangle")
- The prompt text is displayed prominently in the center (2rem/32px font size) with a smooth fade-in animation (300ms)
- Read and memorize the description carefully - visualize the shapes in your mind
- Watch the orange countdown timer at the top showing remaining seconds with a horizontal progress bar
- The instruction "Memorize this description!" appears below the prompt in gray text
- You cannot guess yet - use this time to imagine what object the shapes might represent
- The timer automatically transitions you to the guess phase when it reaches zero
- The prompt fades out smoothly as the phase ends (300ms fade-out transition)
- The component uses the PromptDisplay component which handles the display logic and animations

**Phase 2 - Guess Phase (20 seconds):**

- The prompt disappears and an input field appears with automatic keyboard focus (using autoFocus prop)
- The question "What is being described?" appears above the input in large text (1.5rem/24px)
- Type your answer for what object the geometric description represents
- The input field has a white background with a 2px gray border (#E5E7EB) that turns orange (#FF4500) on focus
- Press Enter or click the orange "Submit Guess" button to lock in your answer
  - The button has hover effects (darker orange #D93900, scale 1.02) and active states (scale 0.98)
  - Minimum height of 48px for easy tapping on mobile devices
- The blue countdown timer at the top shows how much time you have left with a horizontal progress bar
- When time is running low (last 5 seconds), the timer pulses (scale 1.0 → 1.05) and turns red (#EA0027) to create urgency
- If time runs out, your current guess (or empty answer if you didn't type anything) is automatically submitted
- Once submitted, the input and button are disabled and the button text changes to "Submitted!" with a checkmark (✓)
  - The button turns gray and has reduced opacity (0.5) when disabled
- The guess is sent to the server via POST /api/game/submit-guess for validation and scoring
- The component uses the GuessInput component which handles input state, submission, and timer integration

**Phase 3 - Results Phase (10 seconds):**

- The results screen appears with a bounce-in animation for visual impact (animate-bounce-in class)
- **Result indicator** at the top shows if you were:
  - **"Correct!"** (green background #46D160 with ✓) - Exact match or alternative answer accepted
  - **"Close!"** (yellow background #FFB000 with ~) - 70%+ similarity to the correct answer using Levenshtein distance
  - **"Incorrect"** (red background #EA0027 with ✗) - Too different from the correct answer
- **The correct answer** is revealed prominently with "The answer was:" label in large text (1.5rem/24px)
  - Displayed in a white card with rounded corners (12px) and subtle shadow
- **Your guess** is displayed below with "You guessed:" label (if you submitted one, otherwise shows "No answer submitted")
  - Shows in gray text to differentiate from the correct answer
- **Points earned** this round are displayed with color coding and smooth fade-in animation:
  - **+10 points** (green text #46D160) for correct answers
  - **+5 points** (yellow text #FFB000) for close matches
  - **+0 points** (gray text #878A8C) for incorrect answers
- **Total score** updates with a smooth count-up animation from previous score to new score (200ms duration)
  - The animation uses a custom count-up effect that increments the displayed number
- The green countdown timer at the top shows time until the next round with a horizontal progress bar
- A message "Next round starting soon..." appears at the bottom in gray text
- The next round automatically begins when the timer reaches zero, loading a new prompt via POST /api/game/next-prompt
- The leaderboard in the top-right corner updates in real-time to reflect your new score with animated transitions
- The component uses the ResultsDisplay component which handles result presentation and animations

**Classic Mode Scoring:**

- **Correct answer**: +10 points
  - Exact match (case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed)
  - Any alternative answer (e.g., "home" for "house", "bike" for "bicycle")
- **Close answer**: +5 points
  - 70%+ similarity using Levenshtein distance algorithm
  - Examples: "hous" for "house" (80% similar), "bycicle" for "bicycle" (85% similar)
- **Incorrect answer**: 0 points
  - Less than 70% similarity
  - Empty submission (timeout without typing)

**Scoring Algorithm Details:**
- All guesses are normalized (lowercase, trimmed) before comparison
- Levenshtein distance calculates minimum single-character edits needed
- Similarity percentage = (maxLength - distance) / maxLength × 100
- Alternative answers are checked first before similarity calculation

### Consensus Mode Gameplay (In Active Development)

**How It Works:**

Instead of matching a pre-defined answer, you earn points by guessing what other players guess. The crowd determines what's "correct"!

**Round Flow:**

**Phase 1 - Display Phase (5 seconds):** Same as Classic Mode

**Phase 2 - Guess Phase (20 seconds):** Same as Classic Mode
- Your guess is submitted to the crowd aggregation system
- All players viewing the same prompt contribute to the same pool

**Phase 3 - Results Phase (15 seconds with live updates):**

- **Live Poll Visualization**: See all player guesses displayed as animated percentage bars
- **Top 10 Guesses**: Ranked by popularity with real-time vote counts
- **Your Guess Highlighted**: Orange border marks your answer in the list
- **Creator's Answer Marked**: Gold star (⭐) shows what the prompt creator intended
- **Live Updates**: Poll refreshes every 2 seconds as more players submit guesses
- **Consensus Score Display**: Shows your tier badge and match percentage
  - 🏆 **MAJORITY ANSWER** (≥50%): +100 points - "You matched 85% of players!"
  - 🥈 **COMMON ANSWER** (20-49%): +50 points
  - 🥉 **UNCOMMON ANSWER** (5-19%): +25 points
  - 💎 **RARE ANSWER** (1-4%): +10 points
  - ❄️ **UNIQUE ANSWER** (<1%): 0 points
- **Total Players**: Bottom summary shows unique player count and total guesses
- **Viral Moments**: Special badge when crowd consensus differs from creator's intent

**Consensus Mode Features:**

- **Guess Aggregation**: All guesses are normalized (lowercase, trimmed) and grouped
- **Similar Spelling Grouping**: Variants like "jelly fish" and "jellyfish" are combined
- **Close Match Bonus**: 70%+ similarity to a popular answer earns 5 points
- **Historical Results**: View final poll results for 24 hours after the round ends
- **Community Dynamics**: Watch consensus emerge in real-time as rankings shift

**Example Scenario:**

Prompt: "A circle with wavy lines around it"
- Creator's answer: "sun"
- Top community guess: "jellyfish" (85% of players)
- Your guess: "jellyfish"
- **Result**: You earn 100 points for matching the majority, even though the creator said "sun"!
- The game celebrates this as a "Viral Moment" where the crowd reinterpreted the prompt

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Classic Mode Strategy

1. **Visualize carefully**: Picture the shapes in your mind during the 5-second display phase - imagine how they connect
2. **Think common first**: Start with everyday objects that match the description (house, tree, car, etc.)
3. **Trust your instincts**: First thoughts are often correct - don't overthink it
4. **Watch for themes**: Some prompts are Reddit-themed (like "upvote" or "snoo" for the Reddit alien)
5. **Spelling flexibility**: Alternative spellings are accepted (e.g., "ice cream" vs "icecream", "bow tie" vs "bowtie")
6. **Close counts**: Even if you misspell slightly, you might get 5 points for a close match (70%+ similarity)
7. **Act fast**: You can submit early if you're confident - no need to wait for the timer
8. **Learn from mistakes**: Pay attention to correct answers to improve your spatial reasoning

### Consensus Mode Strategy

1. **Think like the crowd**: What would most people guess first? The obvious answer is often the most popular
2. **Avoid overthinking**: Complex or creative answers might be unique (0 points) - simple is better
3. **Learn from results**: Watch which answers become popular to calibrate your thinking for future rounds
4. **First impressions matter**: What's the first thing that comes to mind? That's probably what others will guess too
5. **Creative answers are fun**: Unique guesses won't score points, but they're entertaining to see in the poll!
6. **Watch the live updates**: See how consensus emerges in real-time as more players join

### General Tips

- Your final score is displayed with a completion message
- Click "Play Again" to start a new session with reshuffled prompts
- Each session has a unique ID (format: `postId_username_timestamp_random`) and tracks which prompts you've seen using Redis sorted sets
- Session data expires after 1 hour (3600 seconds TTL) to prevent memory bloat
- Starting a new session resets your score to 0 and clears the used prompts list
- Session metadata is stored in Redis with keys:
  - `session:{sessionId}:score` - Current session score (String)
  - `session:{sessionId}:used` - Set of used prompt IDs (Sorted Set with timestamp scores)
  - `session:{sessionId}:meta` - Session metadata like username, startTime, roundsCompleted (Hash)

### Game Architecture

**State Management:**

The game uses React's useReducer hook for complex state management through the custom `useGame` hook:

- **Game State**: Centralized state object containing:
  - `phase`: Current game phase ('home' | 'display' | 'guess' | 'results' | 'error')
  - `currentPrompt`: Active prompt object with id, promptText, answer, alternativeAnswers, difficulty, category
  - `playerGuess`: User's submitted guess for the current round
  - `score`: Total session score (cumulative across all rounds)
  - `roundsCompleted`: Number of rounds finished
  - `usedPromptIds`: Array of prompt IDs already shown in this session
  - `username`: Reddit username from authentication
  - `postId`: Reddit post ID where the game is running
  - `sessionId`: Unique session identifier
  - `loading`: Loading state for async operations
  - `error`: Error message if something goes wrong

- **Actions**: Dispatched to update state:
  - `START_GAME`: Initialize new game session
  - `LOAD_PROMPT`: Load next prompt from server
  - `START_DISPLAY_PHASE`: Begin 5-second display phase
  - `START_GUESS_PHASE`: Begin 20-second guess phase
  - `SUBMIT_GUESS`: Submit player's guess
  - `START_RESULTS_PHASE`: Show results for 10 seconds
  - `NEXT_ROUND`: Advance to next prompt
  - `SET_ERROR`: Handle error states

**Component Hierarchy:**

```
App (Root)
├── HomeScreen (phase === 'home')
│   └── Play button → startGame()
└── GameScreen (phase === 'display' | 'guess' | 'results')
    ├── Leaderboard (persistent, top-right)
    ├── PromptDisplay (phase === 'display')
    │   └── Timer (5 seconds)
    ├── GuessInput (phase === 'guess')
    │   ├── Input field (auto-focus)
    │   ├── Submit button
    │   └── Timer (20 seconds)
    └── ResultsDisplay (phase === 'results')
        ├── Result indicator (Correct/Close/Incorrect)
        ├── Correct answer display
        ├── Player guess display
        ├── Points earned display
        ├── Total score display
        └── Timer (10 seconds)
```

**API Communication:**

The client communicates with the Express server through RESTful API endpoints:

1. **GET /api/init**: Initialize game with user context (username, postId)
2. **POST /api/game/start**: Create new session, return sessionId
3. **POST /api/game/next-prompt**: Fetch next unused prompt for session
4. **POST /api/game/submit-guess**: Validate guess, calculate score, return results

All API calls use standard `fetch()` with JSON payloads and handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks.

**Phase 2 - Consensus Mode (In Active Development) 🚧**

**Completed:**
- ✅ Shared types (GuessAggregation, ConsensusScore, ConsensusScoreTier, API response types)
- ✅ Guess normalization utility (lowercase, trim whitespace)
- ✅ Redis aggregation service with atomic operations:
  - storeGuess (HINCRBY for atomic increment)
  - addPlayerToSet (ZADD for unique player tracking)
  - storePlayerGuess (SET with 24-hour TTL)
  - getAggregatedGuesses (HGETALL)
  - getTotalPlayers (ZCARD)
- ✅ Consensus scoring algorithm with tier calculation:
  - Majority (≥50%): 100 points
  - Common (20-49%): 50 points
  - Uncommon (5-19%): 25 points
  - Rare (1-4%): 10 points
  - Unique (<1%): 0 points
  - Close match bonus (≥70% similarity): 5 points
- ✅ POST /api/consensus/submit-guess endpoint with validation and error handling
- ✅ POST /api/consensus/get-results endpoint with aggregation, sorting, and player score calculation
- ✅ GuessAggregationBar component with:
  - Animated percentage bars (0 to percentage over 500ms)
  - Color coding (green ≥50%, blue 20-49%, yellow 5-19%, gray <5%)
  - Player guess highlighting (orange border)
  - Creator answer marking (gold border + star icon)
- ✅ PollResultsDisplay component with:
  - Top 10 guess display sorted by count
  - Loading and error states
  - Empty state handling
  - Total players and guesses summary
- ✅ useConsensusPolling hook with:
  - 2-second polling interval
  - Automatic start/stop based on enabled flag
